#Welcome!

This is a personal project where I am making notes and attempting to solve the exercises in Sutton and Barto's Reinformcement Learning (2nd Edition).

This is by no means correct or checked solutions - This is really my attempt to understand and learn (by doing).

There are a number of great resources online, here are some that I have visited:
https://github.com/iamhectorotero/rlai-exercises
https://github.com/LyWangPX/Reinforcement-Learning-2nd-Edition-by-Sutton-Exercise-Solutions
https://micahcarroll.github.io/learning/2018/05/17/sutton-and-barto-rl.html

If you see any mistakes, please let me know. If you want to work on this together, more than happy to do so!

Happy learning.
